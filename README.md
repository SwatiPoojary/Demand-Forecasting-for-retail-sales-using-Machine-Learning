**Demand Forecasting for retail sales using Machine Learning Algorithms**
Group Project for the machine learning module of Masters in Computer Science (Data SCience) at Trinity College Dublin

Large retailers must track high-demand products and guarantee that they do not run out of supply in order to 
maximize profits and operate smoothly. Calculating the sales price for future months is one method for retailers 
to anticipate which goods will yield the most profit. Retailers can then stock the things that are expected to 
generate more revenue and profit. In this project we have applied various Time Series models on the data to 
predict the sales price for the future months.

Input data consisting of order date and retail sales price (in pounds) for Textile, clothing and footwear industry 
collected in CSV format is analysed for every month from Jan 1986 till Sep 2021. We then convert it in time series 
data format to use it in ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) and 
Random Forest models to output the one step ahead forecast of sales in future.
